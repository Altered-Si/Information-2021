Course Project
CISC / CMPE 327 - Fall 2020
Assignment #0: Choose Teams
</p>

The Course Project
All the code/documentation contributions will go through the pull-request/review process
You cannot just email your code to your teammate and ask them to upload. 
There are two options for this project:
1/ Web-based application.
2/ CLI-based application.
We provide GitHub templates for either case; however, we strongly recommend you follow the first path, if you are willing to pick up some modern app design concepts and framework. 
You don't have to make the decision right now.

Assignment #0
You are to form a small independent software company that will contract to produce a high-quality software product to meet the requirements of the project.  You will be marked as a team, and all teammates will receive the same mark for assignments.
For now, the only thing you have to do is to form your company team, agree on a platform for development, choose a company name, and choose a license.  Fill out this form. Save it as a PDF file.
To submit this form, one of the team members following the steps below: 
1/ Following our GitHub instruction, create your GitHub repository.
2/ Create a branch named ‘contract’ and pushed this file to that branch. Directly using the GitHub web interface to upload files is not allowed. 
3/ Create a pull request to the master branch and add all other team members as reviewers.
4/ Merge the pull request to the master branch.
5/ Submit the URL of the pull request to onQ.
All the team members should know how to use git for creating branches and making commits. 

 
We hereby agree to work together as a team on the course project in CISC / CMPE 327.
We understand and agree that our project work will be evaluated as a team and that we will share the team mark for all assignments of the project. If there are any team collaboration issues reported, each member’s contribution through GitHub metrics on pull-request and code reviews will be evaluated and served as a basis for team contribution. 
We each promise to make our best effort to ensure that the team works together and that we equitably share the workload and opportunities for learning on all project phases.
